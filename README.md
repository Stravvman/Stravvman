# Welcome to my personal GitHub portfolio!
_Here is where I shall display projects, ideas and figments as I continue my development._

So far I have:
- [x] Made my Github account
- [x] Solved a handful of problems in Python
- [x] Set out to see what more I can learn
- [ ] Completed my first project

I hope to apply what I've learned and show my works here. 
A student of [HyperionDev](www.hyperiondev.com), I am very grateful for their guidance and support.
